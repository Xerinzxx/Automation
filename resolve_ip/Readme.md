# IP Address Resolver

This Python script reads a list of hostnames from `input.txt`, resolves their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and outputs the results to `output.txt`. It is useful for quickly gathering IP addresses for a set of domain names.

## Features

- Resolves both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Handles errors gracefully, marking entries as "Not Found" if a hostname cannot be resolved.
- Outputs results in a clean, tabular format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
